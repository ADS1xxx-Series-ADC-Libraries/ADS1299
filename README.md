ADS1298-breakout
================

This is an ADS1298 breakout board. The ADS1298 is an 8 channel ADC chip with SPI interface, meant for ECG and EEG:

The breakout board needs +5v input, and provides clean analog and digital power, along with some minimal support circuitry.

Most of the ADS1298's pins are available on the two 20-pin headers.
 
This board is meant for basic system debugging - electrode circuitry for EEG or ECG is not provided, just access to
the chip's differential input pins.

NOTE: This board is untested. I will update this file when I have tested it.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!
