ADS1298-breakout
================

An ADS1298 breakout board. The ADS1298 is an 8 channel ADC chip with SPI interface, meant for ECG and EEG.

This provides clean analog and digital power, along with minimal support circuitry.

Most pins are available on 2 20-pin headers.

This board is meant for basic software debugging - electrode input for EEG or ECG is not provided, just access to
differential input pins.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!

cheers
